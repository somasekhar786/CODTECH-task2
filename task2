-- in this task to create student datatbase management, first we need to create a database
called students--

create database students;

--For using the database we use below command--

use students;

--In students database, we created a table named students consists of different
colomn headings and their datatypes with some constraints like  student_id INT PRIMARY KEY etc..--

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    dob DATE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15)
);

--we create another table as we know that  students mentioned in the task named courses consists of different
colomn headings and their datatypes with some constraints like course_id INT PRIMARY KEY etc..--


CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    instructor VARCHAR(100)
);

--at final we create table named enrollments in the database which consisting of colomn headings and their
datatypes with some constraints like  enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY etc..--

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    grade CHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);

--after creating the tables we need to insert the data into empty tables to store data--
--for inserting data we use below query syntax to insert data in above created tables--

INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, last_name, dob, email, phone_number) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'Johnson', '2000-01-15', 'alice.johnson@example.com', '123-456-7890'),
(2, 'Bob', 'Smith', '1999-05-25', 'bob.smith@example.com', '098-765-4321');

INSERT INTO courses (course_id, course_name, instructor) VALUES
(1, 'Introduction to Computer Science', 'Dr. John Doe'),
(2, 'Calculus I', 'Prof. Jane Doe');

INSERT INTO enrollments (enrollment_id, student_id, course_id, enrollment_date, grade) VALUES
(1, 1, 1, '2023-01-01', 'A'),
(2, 2, 1, '2023-01-01', 'B'),
(3, 1, 2, '2023-01-15', 'A');

--for getting the data that is stored in tables we use below syntax--


select * from students;

select * from courses;

select * from enrollments;

--for updating the data in tables we use below syntax--

update students set email ='yalllankisomu@gmail.com' where student_id=1;

--for deleting the data in tables we use below syntax--

delete from courses where course_id=2;

--before deleting that there is a foreign key reference to delete that so we need to this first--

delete from enrollments where course_id=2;

--for getting the students  by a specific course we use below syntax--

SELECT c.course_name, e.enrollment_date, e.grade FROM courses c
JOIN enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id WHERE e.student_id = 1;

--This query combines information from the students, enrollments, and courses tables to show
which students are enrolled in which courses, along with their enrollment dates and grades.--

SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.course_name, e.enrollment_date, e.grade FROM students s
JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;
